New Move Information:

Currently 130 New Moves from Gen 4 and 5 have been added. All of them with move effects, descriptions and animations. That being said animations and effects are subject to change in future patches.

If you do want to make custom moves you will need to add them to the end of the list of available moves in PGE, as I will be constantly updating this patch once more moves have good quality animations or effects made, and they will continue from where Assurance end off.
