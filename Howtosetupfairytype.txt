How to Set Up Fairy-Type Pokemon and Moves

Setting up custom Fairy-Type Pokemon and Moves is easy but fairly cumbersome and requires hex editing. 

It also should be noted that once a pokemon or move is made into a Fairy type, it will no longer be able to be edited in PGE unless you change it back in your hex editor, so I'd keep track of your offsets, and would only really make a pokemon or move a Fairy once the rest of the data is sorted. 

This is because the Fairy type is in a new type slot 17 (hex), which PGE doesn't recognize as there is a limit of 11 (hex).

To set up Pokemon you'll have to navigate to the Pokemon's type data and change it. The most effective way to do this is by searching for the Pokemon's base stats in this order (HP, Attack, Defense, Speed, Special Attack, Special Defense) in hex. The following two bytes are responsible for the Pokemon's Primary and Secondary type. Change the respective bytes to 17. To make a Pure Fairy type Pokemon, you'll have to change them both.

To set up a new move you'll have to navigate to the move data. This can be done by searching the effect number (hex), and the base power (hex). The following byte is responsible for the type, so just change it to 17. All the moves are in the 900000-9017FF region, so don't touch anything outside of there.

To remove the Fairy type from the current pokemon consult this list and change the 17s to whatever type you want.
