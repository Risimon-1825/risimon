How to Set Up Custom Moves!

First you'll want to add the 'roms' file into Pokemon Game Editor's ini folder, replacing the one there.

You are then free to use Pokemon Game Editor to change movesets around to your heart's content, and add new moves etc.

Adding New Moves -

Adding custom moves is fairly easy, just follow PGE's attack editor for prompts. The main thing to consider is that, if you want to add new animations you have to navigate to the 910000 area and search for space to add the moves. I'd start at around 91A000 if anything, because I may add new move animations myself. The same goes for move descriptins, though thats the 920000 area, and I'd recommend starting at the 92A000 area. Effects are located at 905000, I'd place new effects in the 906000 area as 908000 is where I'm putting the ASM for abilities in there. You'll then need to add a pointer to it in the table at 903B70, remember to move the last pointer behind it.

If you want to make a sound based move, go to 904800 and put the move ID at the end of that table.
