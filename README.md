# Overview

The game is now almost entirely decapitalised.

The few exceptions are actual graphics that act as buttons eg. the Pokemon types that show up.

It also includes Pokedex Fix, so now the proper Pokemon species are shown. I have also taken the liberty to alter a few dex entries to remove some of the more ridiculous or disturbing ones, such as Kadabra's. 

The rom also features an expanded move table, ability table, the physical and special split made by Doesn'tknowhowtoplay, and the routines to show which attack is which

The expanded move table includes 131 new moves from both Gen 4 and Gen 5, while leaving space for 26 custom moves to be added. It features animations and effects from the 'Move Resources Thread'. It also includes a few effects and an expanded Soundproof table. 

Old moves will also have their new effects and base powers to match the most recent games.

There is also an extended Ability Name and Description table, with a lot of new abilities

The game leaves all Firered Scripts intact, so the game itself can be played should you just want Fire Red with decapitalisation and Gen 4 and 5 moves, abilities etc.

The rombase also has the Fairy Type! Currently all known Fairy-type Pokemon from X and Y have been properly retconned (including Mr. Mime...), the same has been done to moves, in addition to adding the new XY Fairy Moves that I'm capable of making. Another feature is the inclusion of the Fairy-Type within the type matchup list in the help system.

Additionally the rombase features XY Style Movesets for all 386 Pokemon. Fairy type Pokemon follow their XY movesets, or BW2 movesets with Fairy moves added.

# Conflicts:

This base IS NOT compatible with YAPE, if you want to edit moves or Pokemon, you will have to use G3HS, G3T or Pokemon Game Editor.

This base IS compatible with JPan's hacked engine. Though you will need to apply this rombase FIRST.

If you do want to make custom moves and/or abilities you will need to add them to the end of their respective lists, as I will be constantly updating this patch once more moves have good quality animations/effects, and they will continue from where Lunar Dance and Quick Feet end off respectively.

In order to maximise compatibility with G3HS, I have changed the name of the rom from BPRE to MrDS, this means it WILL NOT WORK in any romhacking tool except for G3HS UNLESS you change it back AFTER opening it in G3HS!

To do this open the rom up in a Hex Editor and change the bytes at 0x0000AC to say BPRE and NOT MrDS.
The ini for G3HS has been UPDATED so you will need to REPLACE it with the one I provide in the download.
